	To install on macOS
	1. brew install bash-completion
	2. Make sure to update your ~/.bash_profile as instructed
	3. appsody completion > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/appsody

	To install on Linux
	1. On a current Linux OS (in a non-minimal installation), bash completion should be available.
	2. For Debian see the following link for more information:  https://debian-administration.org/article/316/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_1
	3. Make sure to copy the appsody completion file generated above into the appropriate directory for your Linux distribution e.g.
