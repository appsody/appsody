	Command line completion automatically fills in partially typed commands.  This functionality can be added for appsody commands by doing the following:

	appsody completion > "your-directory"/appsody  
	
	To install on Linux
	1. On a current Linux OS (in a non-minimal installation), bash completion should be available. 
	2. For Debian see the following link for more information:  https://debian-administration.org/article/316/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_1 
	3. Make sure to copy the appsody completion file generated above into the appropriate directory for your Linux distribution e.g.
	appsody completion > <your-directory>/appsody
	The <your-directory> could be /etc/bash_completion.d or the output file can be saved in user local directory and sourced from ~/.bashrc file as well.
	
	To install on macOs
	1. Install bash completions if need be with brew or MacPorts  
	2. Make sure to update your ~/.bash_profile as instructed  
	3. Put the output of 'appsody completion' into your bash completions directory e.g. /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/
